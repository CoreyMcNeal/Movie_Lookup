# Movie_Lookup
Python program which scrapes images and titles from a movie website. Clicking on the desired movie's image takes the user to the movie web page.

Utilizes PySimpleGUI to build a graphical user interface for the user, as well as the PIL module to help with the manipulation of file images.

*One of my earliest programs, may try to redo it in another language or fix it up in python
